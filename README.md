# EchoKey: A Unified Mathematical Framework for Complex Systems

## Overview

**EchoKey** is a cutting-edge mathematical framework designed to analyze, control, and optimize complex systems. By integrating principles from quantum mechanics, fractal geometry, recursion theory, synergy analysis, outlier management, and a multidimensional base-10 system, EchoKey provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and managing complexity across diverse domains.

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources to explore and implement EchoKey. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, EchoKey empowers you to tackle high-dimensional, nonlinear, and emergent phenomena with mathematical precision and operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Cyclicity**: Models periodic behaviors using sinusoidal functions.
- **Recursion**: Generates self-referential rules for iterative processes.
- **Fractality**: Incorporates self-similar structures across scales.
- **Regression**: Ensures system stability and returns to equilibrium.
- **Synergy**: Captures emergent properties arising from component interactions.
- **Outlier Management**: Detects and integrates deviations to adapt dynamically.
- **Multidimensional Base-10 System**: Uniformly scales and manipulates high-dimensional data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use EchoKey, you'll need the following:

- **Python 3.8+**
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/EchoKey.git
cd EchoKey
```

### Running the Examples

Navigate to the `examples` folder and run an example script:

```bash
python examples/echo_example.py
```

### Using the Framework

The core EchoKey module can be imported into your project. Here's a quick example:

```python
from echokey import EchoSystem

# Initialize system with parameters
system = EchoSystem(parameters)

# Simulate the system
system.simulate(time_span=100)

# Visualize results
system.plot_results()
```
